The i-PI distribution contains a number of examples and a simple
demonstrative driver code that can be used as the force backend for a
number of simple tests, such as para-hydrogen and Lennard-Joens
potentials. The documentation also contains a simple tutorial to get
started with using i-PI.


i-PI hands-on
-------------
In addition to the tutorial available with
the i-PI main distribution, you can also try an additional set of
guided examples that demonstrate some more advanced features of
i-PI. Note that these examples use some features (such as qTIP4P/F
water and the Zundel cation potentials in the driver code) that are
only available through the development version of i-PI, a snapshot of
which is present within the archive.

All these examples can be downloaded with a [VirtualBox](/notyet.com)
image containing a complete tutorial on Path Integral Molecular
Dynamics explicitly developed for the
[Path Integral Quantum Mechanics: Theory, Simulation and Application School](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-1314.html).

Open source codes that are interfaced with i-PI are also installed in the
VirtualBox image which includes several examples on how to use them. Some of
these codes are:

  * [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/)
  * [Lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov/)
  * [QuatumEspresso](http://quantum-espresso.org)
  * [Siesta](http://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/)

Other examples
--------------

Examples on how to use the interface of i-PI with the [FHI-aims](http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/aims/) code 
are included both in the i-PI distribution and in the FHI-aims distribution, with a detailed explanation in
that code's documentation.

...and more to come...
